# MtGG-Scraper
A python program to webscrape MtG Goldfish's Modern metagame collection and visualize the changes in the modern metagame over time. It will also represent each deck and allow for comparisons between decks (looking at changes in a given archetype over time).

# Backlog
1) Implement as a package or collection of methods that can be used for web scraping MTG decks for various formats
  - Standard, Modern, Legacy primarily
  - Data returned in a standardized format (collection of Deck objects?)
2) Use multiple sites for source data
3) Data visualization (probably in Jupyter notebook)
4) Scrape data biweekly and store in an online database
5) GUI for visualizing deck comparison
